Add sage object definitions (eg sage_invoice)
Add parsing out using from_sage_xml (does this need a separate map to be built)
Add sync_from_sage method
Add generator with sample implementation
Add README
Make tests runnable outside of test:plugins
When returned type in to_xml is builder, wrap the returned in a block (same as when ar models are returned)
Allow multiple proxies on an object to support a model acting as more than one sage data type (ie an Order which also has both addresses inline)
Add test that methods can be blocked out from to_xml using :method_name => nil in user supplied map
